A startup is a firm operated by a small group of individuals that addresses a crisis. A startup can also be formed when the director(s) come up with a potentially brilliant concept. The most major benefit of a startup is that it boosts employment in the country as more and more enterprises pop up. With the potential of greater job opportunities, the Indian government has endeavoured to aid start-up businesses in developing and succeeding in the Indian market. The Startup India Program can help you innovate and improve your economic sustainability.

Now that you have a better understanding of what a startup is and what Startup India Program is all about, let us look at which firms in India qualify as startups.

The startup India Program eligibility criteria

What qualifies you as a Startup India Program participant?
•	The corporation must be either a private limited company or a limited liability partnership.
•	For the first 10 years after registration, the firm remains a startup. The Indian government has increased the period from 7 to 10 years in order to provide enterprises with more chances and tax breaks in the long run.
